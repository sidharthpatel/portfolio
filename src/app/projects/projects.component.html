      Bit-Fil-A is an Angular based, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
      application.
    </li>
    <li>
      The app consists of a navigation bar with valuable information about the
      product(s) such as:
      <ul>
        <li>A <B>Menu</B> to browse through multiple food options</li>
        <li>A <B>Shopping Cart</B> to add/remove items to be purchased</li>
        <li>A <B>Support</B> page to allow customers to review the app.</li>
        <li>
          An <b>About</b> page consisting of a short introduction regarding
          Bit-Fil-A.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      I've added a shopping cart alongside the main menu to allow improved
      usability for the users.
    </li>
    <li>
      Further functionality include price filter, a favorite button that can be
      toggled on/off, and view/hide details button to learn more about a
      sandwich.

      CFR is a project about manipulating images using different algorithms
      using image filters to process images.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have implemented image derivatives using vertical and horizontal sobel
      filters along with the computation of image gradient magnitude and angle.
      Furthermore, I computed the Laplacian filter using the finite-difference
      method dervied from Sobel filters to given image(s).
    </li>
    <li>
      I also generated a Gaussian blur used mainly in graphics software to
      reduce image noise and detail reduction.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, I used upscaling algorithms such as nearest neighbor, bilinear,
      and bicubic functions to interpolate between discrete pixel values to
      allow myself to convert a small image to larger one.

      Breath-First Search is my first large scale project composed of
      complicated algorithms which came accross as hurdles to be overcomed by
      me.
    </li>
    <li>
      It used data structures such as LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and Graph to
      build an application that would, using the BFS and DFS algorithms,
      traverse through a graph data structure where you can start from a
      selected, root, node and traverse the graph thus exploring the neighbor
      nodes to return the shortest path from point A to point B.
    </li>
    <li>
      Given a text file consisting of cities and its associated distance, the
      application is capable of generating a dynamic graph whilst returning the
      desired shortest path from point A to B.
